import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Ancla CLI supports tab completion for commands, subcommands, flags, and dynamic values like org and project slugs.

## Setup

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Zsh">
    Load for the current session:

    ```zsh
    source <(ancla completion zsh)
    ```

    Load permanently (add to an fpath directory):

    ```zsh
    ancla completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_ancla"
    ```

    If completions aren't working, make sure `compinit` is called in your `.zshrc`:

    ```zsh
    autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Bash">
    Load for the current session:

    ```bash
    source <(ancla completion bash)
    ```

    Load permanently:

    ```bash
    ancla completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/ancla
    ```

    Or for a single user:

    ```bash
    ancla completion bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/ancla
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Fish">
    Load for the current session:

    ```fish
    ancla completion fish | source
    ```

    Load permanently:

    ```fish
    ancla completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/ancla.fish
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="PowerShell">
    Load for the current session:

    ```powershell
    ancla completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
    ```

    Load permanently (add to your profile):

    ```powershell
    ancla completion powershell >> $PROFILE
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
